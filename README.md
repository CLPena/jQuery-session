# Intro to jQuery

This lesson is set up a little bit differently than normal. You'll be doing some individual exploration and practice to get yourself comfortable with the jQuery library. There will be some videos to guide you along, as well as a series of questions for each section of the lesson. 

On the job, you'll have to ramp yourselves up to new technologies, libraries and frameworks. This lesson will be a good introduction to that process, and give you practice working with some pretty well established documentation. 

## Set Up:
Follow these steps for setting up the repo:
1. Fork the repo 
2. Clone the forked copy down to your computer
3. Follow the instructions in the README to move through the lesson. In your local copy of the repo, answer any questions outlined in the lesson's markdown files. 


## Submission:
At the end of the lesson, commit all changes made in your local copy, and push up to your remote fork of the repo. 

To submit, make a PR with your pushed up changes to the original repo.

## Following Exercises:
The next page to view / complete will be linked at the bottom of each markdown file.
