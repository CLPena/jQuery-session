# Instructions

The rest of the sections will have a series of exercises in them, many of which will involve writing jQuery. To make things easier, we'll install jQuery in this directory, so that everything has access to the library.

## Set Up:
1. `cd` into this directory (the one called `next`)
2. run `npm install`
3. commit your changes

## Next Steps:
Once you've got jQuery installed, head to the [part-1-selectors]('./part-1-selectors/README.md') directory.
